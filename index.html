        <p id="p1"><i>A puppy is a juvenile dog, generally one less than 12-18 months old.

                Puppies are markedly underdeveloped and dependent on their mothers at birth (displaying altriciality),
                but healthy puppies grow quickly and begin walking thereafter. Puppies generally weigh 8–16 oz
                (0.23–0.45 kg) shortly after birth, depending on the breed.[1]

                A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the
                Yorkshire Terrier. Puppy refers specifically to young dogs,[2] while pup may be used for other animals
                such as wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks.[3]</italic>

        <h2>My History</h2>
        <p id="p2"><i>Puppies are born after an average of 63 days of gestation, emerging in an amnion that is bitten
                off and eaten by the mother dog.[7] Puppies begin to nurse almost immediately. If the litter exceeds six
                puppies, particularly if one or more are obvious runts, human intervention in hand-feeding the stronger
                puppies is necessary to ensure that the runts get proper nourishment and attention from the mother. As
                they reach one month of age, puppies are gradually weaned and begin to eat solid food. The mother may
                regurgitate partially digested food for the puppies or might let them eat some of her solid food.[8] The
                mother usually refuses to nurse at this stage, though she might let them occasionally nurse for comfort.

                At first, puppies spend the large majority of their time sleeping and the rest feeding. They
                instinctively pile together into a heap, and become distressed if separated from physical contact with
                their littermates by even a short distance.[9]

                Puppies are born with a fully functional sense of smell. They are unable to open their eyes. During
                their first two weeks, a puppy's senses all develop rapidly. During this stage the nose is the primary
                sense organ used by puppies to find their mother's teats, and to locate their littermates, if they
                become separated by a short distance. Puppies open their eyes about nine to eleven days following birth.
                At first, their retinas are poorly developed and their vision is poor. Puppies are not able to see as
                well as adult dogs. In addition, puppies' ears remain sealed until about thirteen to seventeen days
                after birth, after which they respond more actively to sounds. Between two and four weeks old, puppies
                usually begin to growl, bite, wag their tails, and bark.[10]

                Puppies develop very quickly during their first three months, particularly after their eyes and ears
                open and they are no longer completely dependent on their mother. Their coordination and strength
                improve, they spar with their littermates, and begin to explore the world outside the nest. They play
                wrestling, chase, dominance, and tug-of-war games.</i></p>
